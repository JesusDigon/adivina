I´m going to talk about Christmas
In the first time I have to tell you that I hated Christmas in the past.
Probably you're wondering why.
Well It was because I worked in a shopping center for 9 years, and the Christmas season was very hard then.
We worked a too much hours and too much public holidays. 
I was very tired when I wanted to enjoy with y friends or family.
Fortunately, it´s a thing of the past.
Now I have holidays in the Christmas season and I can enjoy with my family and friends.
This Christmas I could went to see my father who lives in a little village of Leon from 2 years ago.
Also I could see to my grandma who is 93 years old, and I had dinner whit my uncles.
I don´t usually go that way and we enjoy very much when we got together.
Then I returned to Madrid for spend Christmas Eve and New Year´s Eve with my mother and my sister.
In New Year´s Eve after eat to grapes, I went out to have a good time with my friends and girlfriend.
The following day I went to Malaga whit my girlfriend where she lives.
We went to see a Chritmas ligths in the city center, that it´s very amazing.
Also we had a friend´s birthday party in the beach and we went to see a cavlcade of three kings.
In the end this Chritmas I enjoy very much and it has changed my perspective about Chritsmas.
